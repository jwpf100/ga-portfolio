## Portfolio

Single page portfolio to showcase some of my projects, and provide some background on me.  Created in vanilla HTML, CSS and JS.

## Project Status

This project is currently in development.  Originally created at an early stage of my learning process so needs to be updated with newer projects, and more details about myself and what I am looking to do.

## Reflection

This project was originally created in a few days as a response to a bootcamp entry challenge.  I decided that instead of completing the three challenges they put forward, I would roll them up into a single portfolio that showed all of the requirements they were looking for, and that I could then edit for my own requirements going forward. 

It is, I think, a nice clean example of what can be done with basic HTML, CSS and minimal JS.  There were a couple of nice touches in there, such as the full size leading image, a sticky navbar, and a responsive image gallery with pop up captions.  

Going forward I want to update it to reflect where I'm at now in my journey and add my current projects in there.  I'll make the text areas bit more stylish, and reduce the image sizes so that it loads more quickly.  A contact form is currently in there as a placeholder, so that functionality can be added in as well.
